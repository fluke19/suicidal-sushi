	        		<p>Eteach are a teaching recruitment company which also has a job board. They already had a mobile site but it was built 2 years ago by a solo devloper using jQuery mobile, it was slow, parts didnt work, the user experience was awkward and it looked out of date. Re-doing the site from scratch and making it responsive wasn't an option at the time as it was too costly and time consuming, so my task was to refresh the mobile site and use this to create a mobile site for the sibling company FEjobs.</p>

					<h2>Keep it simple</h2>
	        		<p>I wanted the user journey to make more sense and frustrate users less, we feel this is the major reason why our mobile usage numbers were so low, we just needed to keep it simple. The obvious choice was to remove the forced login to use the site, users should be able to casually browse jobs first and experience what the site has to offer before registering. Other big changes were refreshing the outdated navigation where you had to click on your dashboard before being able to access other parts of the site. We want users to be able to access any part of the site at anytime, without giving them extra clicks. I also wanted an emphasis on simplfying the users ability to search as this is the primary function of the site, so we allowed the user to search using keyword and location text fields whilst adding this to the navigation and the homepage, allowing them to access the search anywhere on the site.</p>
