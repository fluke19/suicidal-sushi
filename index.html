                  <h3>EJF Search</h3>
                  <p>
                    I do freelancing in my spare time and was asked to create a new site for an executive search company.
                    They simply wanted a website that illustrated what they are about and what they do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At first the client explained to me they had issues with a different web designer, where they had handed them a template and asked for them to fill in the information.
                    When the client said they didn't have all the information the web designer dropped them and they came to me to see if I could do anything about this.</p>
                    <p>I first looked at the content and there wasn't a lot of it, so I suggested we go for a single page website and I crafted the wordpress theme from scratch to suit the content and what they wanted to say.</p>
                    <p>The colours and logo were already provided but I liked the purple and felt like it suited the professional, sophisticated and premium feel they wanted, so I kept to a clean and modern style and chose fonts to match that.</p>
                    <p>The site is <a href="http://www.ejfsearch.com" rel="external" target="_blank">live</a>.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Dar Zemora</h3>

                    <p>I was recommended to this client by the client at EJF Search.<p/>
                    <p>The client has a highly rated boutique hotel in Morroco but their website was atleast 5 years old and they wanted a re-design. They were hoping to get a more modern looking website whilst giving off that premium feeling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Like EJF Search they didn't have a great deal of content and told me they wanted a site that only had the essentials and allowed the user to quickly look through the information.
                    I suggested to go for a single page website and have the "book now" link fixed in the header to allow the user to book at any point when browsing the website.</p>
                    <p>One of the most challenging parts of the project was having a gallery on a single page website, I couldn't find any website out there which dealt with that problem,
                      but I feel breaking the different sections into single thumbnails and having the galleries in separate lightboxes was a pretty good solution that I am proud of.</p>
                    <p>The site is not live but I have it hosted <a href="http://www.lukehaynes.me/darzemora" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>. I am currently waiting for more assets but it should be finished soon!</p>

						    	<h3>Eteach mobile</h3>
						    	<p>
						    		Eteach had a mobile site but it was outdated and in dire need of a refresh. The focus was allowing the users to search for jobs as easy as possible because search is the main focus being a job board.
						    	</p>
						    	<p>
	                              I came up with a design that was simplistic and added more emphasis on the search. To have the search as the main focus I introduced a basic search on the home page and a search that can be accessed anywhere from the navigation.
                                <p>The site is now <a href="http://www.eteach.com" rel="external" target="_blank">live</a> but should be looked at on your mobile device.</p>

						    	<h3>Eteach Recruiter</h3>
						    	<p>
						    		Eteach first and foremost are a teaching recruitment company, and it was decided that to do the recruitment job more efficiently they needed a recruitment system.
						    	</p>
						    	<p>
						    		This was more of a detailed design because of the amount of information being displayed on a single page. I worked closely with the user experience manager in making sure the that the user could easily navigate through the journey to allow users to search and create assignments for different teachers whilst making sure the UI was easy to understand.

						    	<p>
						    		Not too long ago when Eteach was expanding they decided to launch Eteach International, this would act as an extended site to Eteach. The code was going to be based off of the Eteach site but give it a more modern feel.
						    	</p>
						    	<p>
						    		We wanted teachers landing on the homepage to be enticed to go and teach aboard, so we thought having a large image slider and interactive world map would help whilst showing available jobs in different countries. Recently I have done work improving the page load and fine tuning, this will be going live in the next few weeks.
